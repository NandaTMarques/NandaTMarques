## Hi ðŸ‘‹

### I'm Fernanda, Fullstack Developer and I work as QA - Quality Assurance Analyst,
<p align="justify">

  I am communicative. I am resilient. I always try to have empathy. I like challenges. I enjoy creating things from scratch and solving problems, developing tests and cooperating with the team.

  I like meeting people and making new friends. In my free time I like to spend time with my family, watch series and meet friends.

  Over almost 10 years as a Lawyer, I developed my ability to work as a team, communicate and think critically.

  I want to become a great professional in the technology area and represent women in this universe where women really need representatives.
Every day I want to impact people more with my work, my welcoming way of being, my dedication, resilience and perseverance.

  I finally discovered what makes my eyes sparkle, what I like to do. Today I know that I am on the path I always wanted to be.
Thanks for your visit, follow me on Linkedin.
See you later.
