Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am from EspÃ­rito Santo, I have lived in the interior of the state of SÃ£o Paulo for 3 years, I am a quiet person, I like meeting people and making new friends, I love the internet, my two daughters, my dogs and my cat, in my free time I like to stay with my family, watching series and going out with friends.
Although I have a law degree, I am studying Software Engineering and I am a student in the Web Development course at Trybe.
Over almost 10 years as a lawyer, I provided services to several companies in the area of â€‹â€‹Telecommunications, Financial Institutions, among others, so I developed my ability to work in teams, communication and critical thinking.
I am currently a student of Web Development at Trybe, I intend to dedicate myself with mastery to the course, become a great professional and represent women in this universe where you need female representatives so much. Every day I want to impact people more with my work, my welcoming way of being, my dedication, resilience and perseverance.
I finally found out what makes my eyes shine, what I like to do. Today I know that I am on the path that I always wanted to be.
Thank you for your visit, follow me on Linkedin. See you later.

About me:

I'm resilient.
I always try to empathize.
I like challenges.
I like to create things from scratch and solve problems.
I'm curious and I love technology.
