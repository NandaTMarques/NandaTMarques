### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I'm Fernanda, 
I'm in a career transition, I'm studying Software Engineering and I'm a student on the Web Development course at Trybe. 
I am communicative. I am resilient. I always try to empathize. I like challenges. I like to create things from scratch and solve problems. 
I like to meet people and make new friends. In my free time I like to stay with my family, watch series and meet friends. 
Over 10 years as a Lawyer, I developed my capacity for teamwork, communication and critical thinking. 
I want to become a great professional in the area of technology and represent women in this universe where women are in great need of representatives. 
Every day I want to impact people more with my work, my welcoming way of being, my dedication, resilience and perseverance. 
I finally found out what makes my eyes shine, what I like to do. Today I know that I am on the path that I always wanted to be. 
Thanks for your visit, follow me on Linkedin. 
See you later.
